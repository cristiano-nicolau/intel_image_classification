\section{Conclusion}

The development of this project proved highly relevant, as it allowed us to successfully apply machine learning algorithms studied in class while also exploring and self-learning advanced techniques through external resources. Throughout the process, we faced challenges, particularly in selecting and fine-tuning models within the constraints of our computational resources. The optimization of hyperparameters and implementation of computationally intensive models, such as DenseNet, required careful consideration to balance performance with the hardware limitations available for training. Despite these challenges, our implementation of CNN-based models, especially DenseNet, demonstrated strong alignment with state-of-the-art solutions, reinforcing the effectiveness of deep learning architectures in image classification tasks.

In conclusion, this project not only deepened our understanding of machine learning applications in image classification but also allowed us to critically evaluate and compare our approaches against published studies and community implementations. We are proud of the results achieved and the knowledge gained, which has equipped us with a strong foundation to tackle similar challenges in the future.
