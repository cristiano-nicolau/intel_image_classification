\begin{abstract}
This project focuses on image scene classification using the Intel Image Classification dataset, which contains images categorized into six classes: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street. We implemented convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including DenseNet and a Forward Neural Network, to develop models capable of accurately classifying these scenes. The models were further enhanced using data augmentation techniques and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance. This work has implications for applications in geospatial analysis, urban planning, and environmental monitoring.
