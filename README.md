# Image Classification Project


## Introduction

The Natural Scenes Image Dataset provides a collection of images from various natural and urban environments, offering an excellent opportunity to build and train image classification models. This dataset can be used for applications like scene recognition, computer vision research, and AI-powered environmental analysis. The dataset includes thousands of images across six distinct categories, making it a valuable resource for image classification tasks.

## About the Dataset

This dataset contains approximately 25,000 images of size **150x150 pixels**, categorized into six different natural and urban scene types:

- **Buildings (0)**
- **Forest (1)**
- **Glacier (2)**
- **Mountain (3)**
- **Sea (4)**
- **Street (5)**

### Dataset Splits

The dataset is pre-divided into three subsets:

1. **Training Set**: Contains approximately 14,000 images.
2. **Test Set**: Contains approximately 3,000 images.
3. **Prediction Set**: Contains approximately 7,000 images.

### Dataset Source

This dataset was initially published by Intel on [Analytics Vidhya](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com) as part of an Image Classification Challenge.

## Applications

This dataset can be used for:

- Scene recognition and classification tasks.
- Training and evaluation of computer vision models.
- Research and experimentation in transfer learning, CNN architectures, and image data preprocessing techniques.
